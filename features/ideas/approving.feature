  As a benevolent dictator
  In order to make sure design and conception are excellent
  I want to approve ideas before they get implemented

    Given a benevolent dictator named "Barnaby"
    And a designed idea "Solo, make it so"

    And I approve the idea
    Then the idea should be approved
    And the idea should be in angle "buildable"

    Then I cannot approve the idea
